<h1>Player Movement using Animator | Unity</h1>
<p>This project is about using Animator Controller to move the player.</p>
<p>
	If you want to use your own animations, you'll need at least three animations:
	<ul>
		<li>Idle</li>
		<li>Walk Forward</li>
		<li>Turn Right or Left (Will mirror it to give us the second one)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
